The `ServiceMixin` function enables you to easily create and maintain classes that follow the [Singleton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern) design pattern. Singleton classes are useful for creating services that should only have one instance in your application at any given time. They provide a way to share state and functionality across your application without the need for global variables or framework-specific state management engines.
