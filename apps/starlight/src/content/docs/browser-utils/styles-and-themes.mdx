import TypeDoc from '@docs/browser-utils/types/styles.md';

The package provides a set of CSS styles and themes primarily intended for my personal use. You are free to use it in your own projects, but I will not be accepting pull requests or issues requesting changes to this part of the library.

## Styles

To use the styles, you need to import the CSS file into your project.

```js
/* JavaScript */
import '@spuxx/browser-utils/styles.css';
```

```css
/* CSS */
@import '@spuxx/browser-utils/styles.css';
```

### Use with native HTML elements

After importing the CSS file, you can use any of the included styles directly in your HTML.
You can look up all available styles in [src/styles](https://github.com/spuxx-dev/jslibs/tree/main/packages/browser-utils/src/styles).

```html
<div class="spx spx-container">
  <button class="spx spx-button" spx-color="gradient" spx-variant="outlined">Click me</button>
</div>
```

### Use with @spuxx/solid

However, the styles are primarily intended for use with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and my [@spuxx/solid](https://spuxx-dev.github.io/jslibs/browser-utils) library.
If you use that library, you simply need to import the styles into your project. Components provided by that library will automatically use the styles.

```jsx
import '@spuxx/browser-utils/styles.css';
import { Button } from '@spuxx/solid';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <Button color="gradient" variant="outlined">
      Click me
    </Button>
  );
}
```

## Themes

To use the themes, you need to import the CSS file into your project.

```js
/* JavaScript */
import '@spuxx/browser-utils/themes.css';
```

```css
/* CSS */
@import '@spuxx/browser-utils/themes.css';
```

### Built-in Themes

The library comes with two built-in themes, `default` and `light`.
Both themes are based on [Tailwind's color palette](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/customizing-colors)
(also see [tailwindcolor.com](https://tailwindcolor.com/)).

- [Default theme](packages/browser-utils/themes/default.theme.css)
- [Light theme](packages/browser-utils/themes/light.theme.css)

You may override each of those themes by creating a CSS file and overwriting any of the variables:

```css
html,
html *,
* {
  /* Overwrite default theme variables */
}

html[spx-theme='light'],
html[spx-theme='light'] *,
*[spx-theme='light'] {
  /* Overwrite light theme variables */
}
```

### Custom Themes

You can also create your own custom themes by creating a CSS file and overwriting any of the variables:

```css
html[spx-theme='my-theme'],
html[spx-theme='my-theme'] *,
*[spx-theme='my-theme'] {
  /* Overwrite any of the default theme variables */
}
```

> ðŸ›ˆ Note: You do not need to overwrite all of the variables. You can only overwrite the ones you want to change.

You may then import your custom theme into your project:

```js
/* JavaScript */
import './themes/my-theme.css';
```

```css
/* CSS */
@import './themes/my-theme.css';
```

You may then use your theme by setting the `spx-theme` attribute on the `html` element:

```html
<html spx-theme="my-theme">
  ...
</html>
```

### Theme individual components

Themes are usually applied to the entire document (by setting the `spx-theme` attribute on the `html` element).
However, you can also apply a theme to individual components.

To do this, you can use the `spx-theme` attribute on the element itself.

```html
<div spx-theme="my-theme">...</div>
```

## Variables and Types

The library also provides a set of variables and types for use with TypeScript. They can help you use the styles correctly and in a type-safe manner.
They are primarily intended for use with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and my [@spuxx/solid](https://spuxx-dev.github.io/jslibs/browser-utils) library.
