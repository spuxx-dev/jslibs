The library also provides a set of variables and types for use with TypeScript. They can help you use the styles correctly and in a type-safe manner.
They are primarily intended for use with [SolidJS](https://www.solidjs.com/) and my [@spuxx/solid](https://spuxx-dev.github.io/jslibs/browser-utils) library.
